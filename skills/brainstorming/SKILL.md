# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## No-Argument Invocation - Source Collection

When `/superpowers:brainstorm` is invoked without any arguments, first collect information sources:

**Step 1: Collect Information Sources**

Use AskUserQuestion to ask for the following (user can provide URL or skip):
- Jira URL (optional)
- API endpoint URL - Apifox (can skip)
- Figma URL (can skip)

**Step 2: Request Requirements Description (if needed)**

If user did not provide Jira URL, ask:
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- What functionality do you expect?

**Step 3: Fetch MCP Information**

- If API URL provided, call apifox-mcp to get API summary
- If Figma URL provided, call figmap-mcp to get design summary
- On failure: log reason and continue (don't block)

**Step 4: Determine feature-name**

Determine feature name from these sources (priority high to low):
1. Jira ticket title
2. Keywords from user description
3. Ask user

**Step 5: Create sources.md**

Create `sources.md` in `openspec/changes/<feature-name>/` directory with this format:

```markdown
# <Feature Name> - Sources

## Information Sources

| Type | Link |
|------|------|
| Jira | <url or "Not provided"> |
| API (Apifox) | <url or "Not provided"> |
| Figma | <url or "Not provided"> |

## PRD Description

<Description from Jira or manually provided by user>

## API Summary

> Source: apifox-mcp

<API summary or "⚠️ Failed to fetch - <reason>">

## Design Summary

> Source: figmap-mcp

<Design summary or "⚠️ Failed to fetch - <reason>">

**Step 6: Enter Normal Brainstorming Flow**

With collected context (PRD description, API summary, design summary), proceed to "The Process" section below.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**OpenSpec Integration:**
- Ask: "Do you want to create an OpenSpec change document for this design?"
- If yes, create complete OpenSpec change structure:
  ```
  openspec/changes/<feature-name>/
  ├── sources.md       # Information sources and PRD (generated by source collection phase)
  ├── proposal.md      # Extract from design discussion (Why, What Changes, Impact)
  ├── design.md        # Technical decisions from design
  ├── tasks.md         # High-level task checklist from design
  ├── plan/            # Empty directory for writing-plans
  └── specs/           # If spec changes needed
  ```

**proposal.md content:**
- `## Why` - Purpose and motivation from discussion
- `## What Changes` - Summary of changes from design
- `## Impact` - Affected code and specifications

**tasks.md content:**
- Break design into high-level tasks
- Use OpenSpec format: `- [ ] N.N Task description`

**Implementation (if continuing):**
- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"
- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace
- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan in `openspec/changes/<feature>/plan/`

## Key Principles

- **Source collection first** - When no arguments provided, collect Jira/API/Figma sources before exploring ideas
- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
